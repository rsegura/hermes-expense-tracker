# Hermes Expense Tracker

**Shared household expenses, by chat.** Each family member gets their own assistant on [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) — Telegram, CLI, or other channels — while everyone reads and writes the **same SQLite database**. All business logic lives in a Python MCP server; Hermes profiles only converse and call tools.

Repository: [github.com/Canopix/hermes-expense-tracker](https://github.com/Canopix/hermes-expense-tracker)

**Good fit for:** couples, families, roommates, or any group tracking shared spending without building a custom app.

**Not in scope:** debt tracking, settlements, or “who owes whom” balances. You get `paid_by`, per-person **allocations** (who the expense is *for*), and reports comparing paid vs attributed totals — but no automatic debt ledger.

---

## Quick start (Hermes already installed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Canopix/hermes-expense-tracker.git ~/hermes-expense-tracker
cd ~/hermes-expense-tracker
chmod +x install.sh bootstrap.sh add-member.sh
./install.sh
```

Then **per member** (replace `alice` with your slug):

- [ ] `hermes -p alice setup` — model + API key
- [ ] `alice gateway setup && alice gateway start` — Telegram bot
- [ ] `hermes -p alice pairing approve telegram <CODE>`
- [ ] `hermes -p alice mcp test expense-tracker` — expect **38 tools, ✓ Connected**
- [ ] `alice chat` — *"Log $50 at the pharmacy, I paid"*

## How it works

**Request path** (every message follows the same steps):

1. **Member** — Alice, Bob, or CLI sends a message (Telegram or `alice chat`).
2. **Hermes profile** — `expense-<slug>` loads SOUL + skills from `locales/`, calls only expense MCP tools.
3. **MCP server** — Python FastMCP runs the tool (`add_expense`, `generate_report`, …).
4. **Database** — reads or writes the shared file `~/expenses/data/expenses.db`.

| From | To | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| Member (Telegram, CLI) | Hermes profile | chat / gateway |
| Hermes profile | MCP server | stdio — tools named `mcp_expense_tracker_*` |
| MCP server | SQLite | `EXPENSE_DB_PATH` (same path for every profile) |

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Hermes profile** | Chat UI, model, Telegram gateway. Restricted to expense MCP only (`platform_toolsets: [mcp-expense-tracker]`). |
| **SOUL + skills** | Domain guardrails, confirmation format, tool usage patterns. Copied from `locales/en/` or `locales/es/` on install. |
| **MCP server** | CRUD, reports, charts, budgets, project visibility. Single source of truth. |
| **SQLite DB** | Shared across all profiles. Path: `~/expenses/data/expenses.db`. |

**Important:** expense data never goes into Hermes `state.db` or `memories/`. Hermes memory is disabled in the template (`memory.memory_enabled: false`).

Each profile sends two env vars to the MCP:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EXPENSE_MEMBER_SLUG` | Who is calling — filters project visibility and scopes actions |
| `EXPENSE_LOCALE` | Language for report/chart labels (`en` or `es`) |

---

## Core concepts

### Persons

A **person** is anyone who can pay for or be allocated an expense. Members with a bot are created via `add-member.sh`. Others (kids, relatives) can be added by chat: *"Create person Aunt Rosa"*.

### Expenses

Every expense has:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `paid_by` | Who actually paid (slug) |
| `allocations` | Who the expense counts toward — must sum to 100% |
| `category` | e.g. groceries, transport, health |
| `project` | Optional — home, vacation, wedding, etc. |
| `amount`, `currency`, `date`, `description` | Standard fields |

If you don't specify allocations, the MCP assigns **100% to the payer**.

Example: Alice pays $120 for groceries split 50/50 → `paid_by: alice`, `allocations: [{alice: 50}, {bob: 50}]`.

### Projects

Projects group expenses (home, vacation, health, custom). Each project has an **owner** and optional **members**:

- **Personal** — only the owner sees and logs expenses there
- **Shared** — owner invites others; all members see project expenses in lists and reports

You only see projects you own or were invited to. Expenses without a project are visible to everyone.

### Categories

Seeded at bootstrap (groceries, transport, health, etc.). You can create custom categories by chat. Categories support parent/child hierarchy.

### Budgets

Monthly spending limits per category. The MCP tracks progress and can alert when you're near or over budget (`budget_status`).

### Reports vs raw summaries

- **Summary tools** (`monthly_summary`, etc.) return structured JSON for the agent to format
- **`generate_report`** returns ready-to-send markdown (with optional ASCII bar charts)
- **`render_chart`** returns a PNG image (category breakdown, project breakdown, monthly trend, top expenses)

---

## What you can do

Everything below is done **by chatting** with your bot (or CLI). You never touch SQL or Python.

### Log and manage expenses

| You say | MCP does |
|---------|----------|
| *"Log $80 at the pharmacy, I paid"* | `add_expense` with today's date |
| *"Yesterday's taxi $15, split with Bob"* | `add_expense` + 50/50 allocations |
| *"Show last 10 expenses"* | `list_expenses` (paginated) |
| *"Search farmacia"* | `search_expenses` |
| *"Delete expense #42"* | `delete_expense` (with safety checks) |

### Understand spending

| You say | MCP does |
|---------|----------|
| *"How much in June?"* | `generate_report(period="month", year=2026, month=6)` |
| *"June vs May"* | `compare_months` |
| *"Top 5 expenses this month"* | `top_expenses` |
| *"How much on groceries this year?"* | `category_summary` or filtered report |
| *"What did Alice pay vs what was attributed to her?"* | `person_summary` |

### Projects

| You say | MCP does |
|---------|----------|
| *"Create project Wedding 2027"* | `create_project` (you become owner) |
| *"Invite Johanna to vacation project"* | `add_project_member` |
| *"Expenses for home project"* | `project_summary` or filtered `list_expenses` |
| *"Wedding project report"* | `generate_report(period="project", project="wedding")` |

### Charts and export

| You say | MCP does |
|---------|----------|
| *"Category chart for June"* | `render_chart("by_category", ...)` → PNG sent in chat |
| *"Monthly spending trend 2026"* | `render_chart("monthly_trend", year=2026)` |
| *"Export June as CSV"* | `export_expenses_file("csv", start_date=..., end_date=...)` |

### Budgets

| You say | MCP does |
|---------|----------|
| *"Set $500 budget for groceries"* | `set_category_budget` |
| *"Which budgets am I about to break?"* | `budget_status` |
| *"List all budgets"* | `list_category_budgets` |

### Household setup (conversational)

| You say | MCP does |
|---------|----------|
| *"Let's set up"* / *"First time"* | `onboarding` skill — projects, budgets, first expense |
| *"Create person Tía Rosa"* | `create_person` (no bot needed) |
| *"Add category Pets"* | `create_category` |

---

## Internationalization (EN + ES)

During `./install.sh`, the wizard **always asks** for household language first (`English` or `Español`).

| Layer | Language |
|-------|----------|
| Code, tests, MCP errors | English (canonical) |
| `README.md`, `docs/en/` | English |
| `docs/es/` | Spanish |
| Agent SOUL + skills | `locales/en/` or `locales/es/` |
| Reports + chart labels | `EXPENSE_LOCALE` (`en` \| `es`) |
| Expense descriptions in DB | Whatever you type in chat |

- Locale is stored in `~/.expenses/locale` and in each profile `.env` as `EXPENSE_LOCALE`.
- Manual install: `EXPENSE_LOCALE=en ./add-member.sh alice Alice`
- Existing installs without locale default to **Spanish** on `./update.sh` (legacy behavior).

**Docs:** [`docs/en/`](docs/en/README.md) · [`docs/es/`](docs/es/README.md) · Technical briefing: [`docs/en/BRIEFING.md`](docs/en/BRIEFING.md)

---

## Prerequisites

- [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) installed (`hermes --version` >= 0.14.0)
- Python 3.11+
- LLM API key (OpenRouter, your own endpoint, etc.)
- One Telegram bot **per person** who wants to chat (via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

---

## Installation

### Option A — Guided (recommended)

Terminal wizard with Rich panels: prerequisites, short prompts, no `pip` spam.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Canopix/hermes-expense-tracker.git ~/hermes-expense-tracker
cd ~/hermes-expense-tracker
chmod +x install.sh bootstrap.sh add-member.sh
./install.sh
```

The wizard asks:

1. **Household language** — English or Español
2. Bootstrap MCP + database (if needed)
3. How many members get their own bot
4. Display name + slug per member
5. Optional people without a bot (expenses only)
6. Optional default projects (home, vacation, health)

> Paste into another AI with terminal access: [`docs/en/TO-INSTALL.md`](docs/en/TO-INSTALL.md) · [`docs/es/PARA-INSTALAR.md`](docs/es/PARA-INSTALAR.md)

### Option B — Manual

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
EXPENSE_LOCALE=en ./add-member.sh alice Alice
EXPENSE_LOCALE=en ./add-member.sh bob Bob
```

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `bootstrap.sh` | MCP venv, schema, default categories, `.env.paths` |
| `add-member.sh` | Person in DB + Hermes profile + SOUL/skills from `locales/${EXPENSE_LOCALE}/` |

This product **does not** ask for API keys or Telegram tokens in `install.sh`. That is configured in Hermes per profile.

---

## After install — configure Hermes (per profile)

`add-member.sh` prints the profile path (typically `~/.hermes/profiles/expense-<slug>/`). Commands use the short **alias** `<slug>`:

```bash
alice gateway          # same as hermes -p expense-alice gateway
hermes -p alice chat   # explicit profile name
```

**What each layer configures:**

| What | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| MCP paths (`EXPENSE_*`) | Profile `.env` | `add-member.sh` writes them; `config.yaml` resolves `${...}` |
| `EXPENSE_MEMBER_SLUG` | Profile `.env` | Set automatically per member |
| `EXPENSE_LOCALE` | Profile `.env` + MCP env | From install wizard or manual |
| Model / provider / API key | `config.yaml` | `hermes setup` or edit manually |
| Telegram, gateway, pairing | `config.yaml` + gateway | `<slug> gateway setup` |
| SOUL, skills, toolsets | Installed profile | Copied from `locales/` on install |

### Telegram and startup

```bash
alice gateway setup
alice gateway start
hermes -p alice pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

Verify MCP:

```bash
hermes -p alice mcp test expense-tracker
# 38 tools, "✓ Connected"
```

Try:

```bash
alice chat
# "Log $50 at the pharmacy, I paid" / "How much did we spend this month?"
```

Repeat model + Telegram setup for each member (`bob`, etc.).

### Post-install checklist (each member)

| Step | Command | Expected |
|------|---------|----------|
| Model configured | `hermes -p <slug> setup` | Provider + API key saved |
| MCP connected | `hermes -p <slug> mcp test expense-tracker` | 38 tools, ✓ Connected |
| Telegram gateway | `<slug> gateway setup && <slug> gateway start` | Gateway running |
| Pairing | `hermes -p <slug> pairing approve telegram <CODE>` | Bot responds in chat |
| Smoke test | `./scripts/smoke-test.sh expense-<slug>` | Expense logged + monthly query |

### Telegram UX (quiet)

The `expense-member` template is configured for a clean chat:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `display.tool_progress: off` | No `⚙️ mcp_expense_tracker_*` messages |
| `display.interim_assistant_messages: false` | No interim narration ("Creating category...") |
| `telegram.reactions: true` | 👀 while processing, 👍 when done |
| SOUL + skill | Structured confirmation (`Done ✅` + bullets), no tool narration |

**Member slug:** short name only (`emanuel`, `johanna`). **Do not** use `expense-johanna` — `add-member.sh` adds the `expense-` prefix to the Hermes profile name.

New installs inherit UX from the template. `add-member.sh` always re-personalizes SOUL (also after `profile update`).

### Conversational onboarding

With MCP connected, the first chat can guide projects, budgets, and the first expense:

```bash
alice chat
# "Let's set up" / "First time"
```

The `onboarding` skill asks one question at a time. It **does not** create profiles or bots — that is `install.sh` / `add-member.sh`.

### People without a bot

If someone participates in expenses but does not chat:

- From any profile: *"Create person Aunt Rosa"*
- Agent calls `create_person`
- They appear in DB for allocations and reports
- **No** `./add-member.sh` or Telegram bot required

## Tests

```bash
cd mcp/expense-tracker
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Covers repositories, project membership, reports, i18n, and end-to-end flows.

---

## Update

```bash
cd ~/hermes-expense-tracker
git pull                    # if using git
./update.sh                 # bootstrap + all expense-* profiles
```

`update.sh`:

1. Rebuilds MCP venv if needed
2. Runs DB migrations (e.g. project membership)
3. `hermes profile update` on each `expense-*` profile
4. Re-applies SOUL/skills via `add-member.sh`
5. Merges Telegram UX + `EXPENSE_MEMBER_SLUG` + `EXPENSE_LOCALE`
6. Restarts gateways if running

After updating:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-test.sh expense-alice
```

Duplicate profile name (`expense-expense-johanna`):

```bash
./scripts/repair-profile.sh johanna Johanna expense-expense-johanna
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| MCP won't connect | `hermes -p <slug> mcp test expense-tracker`; check `EXPENSE_MCP_*` in profile `.env` |
| Different expenses per profile | `EXPENSE_DB_PATH` must be **identical** in all profiles |
| Telegram not responding | `<slug> gateway status`; check token and `allow_from` |
| Pairing rejected | `hermes -p <slug> pairing approve telegram CODE` (use `-p`) |
| Agent answers off-topic | Check `platform_toolsets: [mcp-expense-tracker]` in `config.yaml` |
| Person missing when logging expense | `./add-member.sh` or `create_person` from the bot |
| Profile `expense-expense-*` | `./scripts/repair-profile.sh <slug> <name> <old-profile>` |
| SOUL still has `{{MEMBER_NAME}}` | `./add-member.sh <slug> <name>` or `./update.sh` |
| Reports in wrong language | Set `EXPENSE_LOCALE=en` or `es` in profile `.env`, then `./update.sh` |
| Project expenses invisible | Check project membership — caller must be owner or invited |
| Charts not sending in Telegram | Agent must attach the PNG path from `render_chart` |
